The proposed target of the system we are about to develop is to 
</h5>

<h7>
1) To predict imminent natural diasters (of predictable disasters like floods, landslides, Tornado etc.) using past data (example https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/landslide-events)
<br>
2) To hightlight the regions of maximum danger on maps within a given time frame.
<br>
3) List regions according to the intensity of impact (predicted using ML) and plot on maps.
<br>
4) Propose an optimum evacuation stratergy based on safer regions in proximity of the probable affected areas.
